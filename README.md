The process which i followed for Attempting the assignment:
Opened Vs code written all the codes making a three different text files then started debugging solved some errors and then the task was successfully running
The Output which i wanted was successfull 
After Writing the code you should first save it then there is run option start debugging and then it will automatically run and you will get your output and if error occurs solve your errors and then follow the same process
Note it that the file you are debugging has extension 
Eg: If you are running Python file you should have python extension then only you will get the output
If you don't have extension download the extension then start running you will get the output
This is the setup process of how to run the application.
